## Crypto-currency-tracker
A real-time cryptocurrency and currency tracker built with Python and Streamlit, fetching live data via the CoinGecko API.

# The Challenge
Investors and hobbyists often need to check the prices of various currencies (like USD to EUR) or cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) throughout the day. Opening a massive financial news site can be slow, cluttered with ads, and overwhelming.

# The Solution
You will build a clean, ad-free web dashboard hosted on your localhost that:

1. Fetches Live Data: Connects to a real-world financial API to get the latest prices.

2. User Customization: Allows the user to select which currency or crypto they want to track via a dropdown menu.

3. Data Visualization: Displays a simple metric (the price) and perhaps a small chart or "success" message if the price is above a certain threshold.

4. Instant Refresh: Updates the data whenever the user interacts with the page.
